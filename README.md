# Student_data-analysis
This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing student scores based on various influencing factors. Utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project explores how different variables impact student performance and provides visual insights into the data.

**Project Details**
Objectives
Analyze the dataset of student scores to understand performance trends.
Investigate the relationship between student scores and various influencing factors such as study time, attendance, and socio-economic background.
Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings and insights.
Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating basic plots and visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations and enhanced plots.
Data
The dataset includes:

Student ID: Unique identifier for each student.
Scores: Scores achieved by students in various subjects.
Study Time: Number of hours spent studying per week.
Attendance: Percentage of classes attended.
Socio-Economic Factors: Information on family income, parental education level, etc.
Key Analysis
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics of student scores and influencing factors.
Correlation Analysis: Exploration of correlations between scores and factors like study time and attendance.
Regression Analysis: Predictive modeling to determine how well various factors predict student performance.
Visualizations:
Distribution plots to show score distributions.
Scatter plots to explore relationships between scores and other variables.
Heatmaps to visualize correlations.
